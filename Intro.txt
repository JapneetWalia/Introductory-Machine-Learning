APPLICATION OF ML TO LARGE DATABASES IS CALLED DATA MINING.

Types of ML
* Supervised - outcome variable is known (e.g- spam predictions)
     two categories: classification and regression 
* Unsupervised -  try to find hidden patterns using clusturing techniques


Another type of ML - Reinforcement Learning (a feedback(eg points) is given to the agent for its decisions, using which it learns.

SUPERVISED:
-neural networks
-decision trees
-bayesian learning
-ensemble learning
-rule-based learning
-support vector machines
-evolutionary algo

Steps in Model Development:
Problem definiton -> selection of variables(dependent and independent) -> Data Collection(using some techniques) -> Selection of data analysis techniques
-> Data preprocessing(identifying the outliers, etc) -> Model training -> model validation -> prediction of new instances


Selecting Variables:
Discrete-nominal(e,g- sex), ordinal(e.g- humidity(high,medium,low))
Continuous- Interval(e.g- temp), Ratio(e.g- weight), Absolute
Selection of VAriables is based on:
 - Researcher's experience
 - existing published researchs
 - advice from mentor


Data Collection(from S/W repositories):
-Academic (developed by university students)
-Industrial (some private organization)
-Public (open source public repositories)


Selection of ML technique
Criteria :
- Type of Dependent variable
- Nature of Data Set (Diversity, Redundancy,type and existence of interactions among variables, size of training set)
- Imp. aspects of diff algo (Accuracy-predictive power, speed, interpetability- understandability, simplicity)
- Other (Ability to handle missing values, Sensitivity to outliers, Ability to handle class imbalance, Ability to handle non-vector data, 
           Efficacy in high dimensions, Accuracy od class probability estimates)
 * Synthetic sampling      
 * Need to satisfy pre-qualifications to use a technique



Model Development:
 1. Divide data into two parts-training and testing(hold-out (2/3 training + 1/3 testing. only applicable on large data sets), K-fold cross validation, 
     Leave-one-out Validation)
 2. Selecting the relevant   

Concerns in model prediction :
 1. Overfitting(empirical error is very less, generalization error is very large)- learns noise rather than relationships
 2. High variance - ()
 3. High bias - (increase independent variables)

ML ALGOs:
 1. Decision trees
 2. K-nearest value
 3. Naive Bayesian classification - based on prior probability
